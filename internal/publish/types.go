// Package publish implements crash-consistent per-target publication for the
// polytoken-quota reconciler. It writes validated candidate bytes to live
// Polytoken files through a write-ahead journal: lock, recover any prior
// journal, create bounded mode-preserving backups, write the journal, apply
// each file via a same-filesystem temp file + atomic rename, publish state.json
// last as the commit record, and finally remove the journal.
//
// The journal records only hashes and paths — never file content, credentials,
// or raw config. On the next invocation Recover compares the journal, live-file
// hashes, backups, and committed state revision and either rolls forward
// (publishes the recorded state), restores the whole target from backup, or
// performs a no-op coherent commit. Every recovery path ends by atomically
// publishing state.json with the accepted event state and final per-target
// outcomes before the journal is removed.
